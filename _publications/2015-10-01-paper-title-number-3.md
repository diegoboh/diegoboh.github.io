excerpt: 'In this paper, I explore the macroeconomic implications of the Fed acting as the international lender of last resort to foreign global banks during periods of crisis. To do so, I develop a stylized and tractable model that captures important characteristics of the global financial system in the run-up to the 2008 crisis, such as non-US global banks that invest in US assets but are exposed to dollar liquidity shortages. Under this framework, multiple equilibria are possible and one of them resembles a global financial crisis: large dollar appreciation, tighter financial conditions, weaker aggregate demand, and output losses. Due to a feedback loop between the exchange rate and banks' soundness, these episodes might be self-fulfilling. Since the liquidity needs of global banks are dollar-denominated, the Fed is better equipped to eliminate the "bad" equilibrium compared to other central banks when the dollar is strong. However, the incentives from the US to intervene, via dollar swap lines, might not be aligned with those of the rest of the world.'
